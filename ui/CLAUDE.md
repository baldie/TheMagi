* The user interface is very fragile, so be careful not to make large
edits without checking in.

* Try to do most of the visual changes via SCSS first, and then if it cannot be done that way, html.

* The goal is to keep the javascript and html bundle being sent to the browser as light as possible, so if a new framework is required, opt for the most lightweight and simple one.
